# Plotline Frontend Assessment

I, Tanay Mittal, am making this project in accordance with the figma file provided by Plotline for this assessment.
I used React to manage state of all the various attributes of the tooltip component I created and render all the changes dynamically through a form as 
given in the Figma file that was provided to us.

## Available Scripts
